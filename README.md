🎓 Student Grade Management System

A Java-based console application designed to manage student records and grades efficiently using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

📖 Overview

The Student Grade Management System allows users to add, manage, and evaluate student academic performance through a menu-driven interface.
The application demonstrates core Java and OOP concepts commonly required in academic and entry-level software projects.

✨ Key Features

Add new students with unique IDs

Assign multiple grades to students

Automatically calculate average scores

Determine grade levels based on performance

View individual or all student records

Delete students from the system

Track user menu choice history

Robust input validation and error handling

🧠 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

Encapsulation: Student attributes are protected using private access modifiers.

Abstraction: Business logic is hidden behind method calls.

Class & Object Design: Clear separation of responsibilities.

Array of Objects: Efficient in-memory student management.

Exception Handling: Prevents crashes due to invalid input.

📈 Future Enhancements

Replace fixed-size arrays with dynamic collections

Persist data using file handling or database integration

Introduce a graphical user interface (JavaFX / Swing)

Implement user authentication and roles
